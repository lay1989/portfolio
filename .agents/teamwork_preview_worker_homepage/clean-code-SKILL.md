# Clean Code Skill

This skill embodies the principles of "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). Use it to transform "code that works" into "code that is clean."

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
> "Code is clean if it can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author." — Grady Booch

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- **Writing new code**: To ensure high quality from the start.
- **Reviewing Pull Requests**: To provide constructive, principle-based feedback.
- **Refactoring legacy code**: To identify and remove code smells.
- **Improving team standards**: To align on industry-standard best practices.

## 1. Meaningful Names
- **Use Intention-Revealing Names**: `elapsedTimeInDays` instead of `d`.
- **Avoid Disinformation**: Don't use `accountList` if it's actually a `Map`.
- **Make Meaningful Distinctions**: Avoid `ProductData` vs `ProductInfo`.
- **Use Pronounceable/Searchable Names**: Avoid `genymdhms`.
- **Class Names**: Use nouns (`Customer`, `WikiPage`). Avoid `Manager`, `Data`.
- Method Names: Use verbs (`postPayment`, `deletePage`).
